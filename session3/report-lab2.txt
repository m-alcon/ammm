a.
	- We changed the variable x_tc from float to boolean.
b.
	- P1:
		Solution (optimal) with objective 0.723773179127243
			CPU 1 loaded at 0.723773%
			CPU 2 loaded at 0.723773%
			CPU 3 loaded at 0.723773%
		Time 0.078s
		Algorithm LP
		2 variables and (#tasks + 2*#computers) constraints
	- P2:
		Solution (optimal) with objective 0.799239077773661
			CPU 1 loaded at 0.725908%
			CPU 2 loaded at 0.616483%
			CPU 3 loaded at 0.799239%
		Time 0.172s
		Algorithm MILP
		2 variables and (#tasks + 2*#computers) constraints
c.
	- The new task can't be done with this configuration even though the total load of the tasks is lower than the total capacity of the computers.
d.
	- With this problem modification, the algorithm always rejects the tasks with highest load.
e.
	- We removed the 3rd constraint in P2a and we changed the objective constraint to:
		minimize sum(t in T)rt[t]-(sum(c in C)sum(t in T) x_tc[t,c]*rt[t]);
f.
	- P2:
		2 variables and (#tasks + 2*#computers) constraints
		Time 0.12s
	- P2a:
		2 variables and (#tasks + 2*#computers + 1) constraints
		Time 0.172s
	- P2b:
		2 variables and (#tasks + #computers + 1) constraints
		Time 0.25s
